target string
start empty string
add characters until new string = target
append arbitrary character to new string (cost of X)
clone aby substring of new string and append it to the end of the new string (cost of Y)

understood

vars:
clone_cost, append_cost, targetStr, endStr, endStr_substring

clone/append math

clone is more effective if:
	clone_cost/len(clone_string) < append_cost
append is more effective if:
	append_cost < clone_cost/len(clone_string)
can use both if:
	append_cost=clone_cost/len(clone_string)
	but use clone since it takes less time
	

problem: find if there is a substring present in endStr
